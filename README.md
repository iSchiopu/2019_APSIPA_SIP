Submitted for publications on March 20, 2019; revised on May 15, 2019.

The repository contains the 24 trained models employed for Macro-Pixel synthesis and lossless coding of light field images.
The models were trained based on 10 LF images from JPEG Pleno Database jpeg.org/plenodb/lf/epfl.

Two models were trained, MPS-CNN for synthesis and PSMP-CNN for coding, for the three color channels (R, G, B), and for the 4 proposed configuration (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5).
